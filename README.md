Lung Cancer Disease Mapping in Pennsylvania.

In this project, I have considered lung cancer incidence rate in Pennsylvania, United States, in the year 2002. Given the data, I developed a disease mapping model to estimate lung cancer risk in Pennsylvania. With the model in mind, I investigated a reasonable measure of the spatial association in the number of lung cancer cases in Pennsylvania by accounting for the proportion of smokers in each county.
